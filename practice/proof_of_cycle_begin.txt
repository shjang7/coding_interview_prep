Phase 1 : hare and tortoise meet in cycle
Phase 2 : one starts from Phase 1 point, one starts from initial point, and they meet at the point of cycle begin
p = hare position
q = tortoise position
k = hare and tortoise meeting point
m = distance between initial point and starting of the cycle
l = the length of the cycle

Dist_p = m + p * l + k
Dist_q = m + q * l + k
* Basically, p moves twice quicker than q
Dist_p = 2 * Dist_q
m + p * l + k = 2 * (m + q * l + k)
0 = m + (2ql - pl) + k
0 = m + k + l(2q - p)
l(p - 2q) = m + k
* p - 2q is integer a
a*l - k = m
a=1 => l - k = m
a=2 => 2l - k = m
a=3 => 3l - k = m
Therefore, in phase 2 movement, the one starts from k, after m movement, it locates at the point of cycle begin.
So, another one starts from initial point moves m, the two will meet.
