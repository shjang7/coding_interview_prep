# Code design
#### Why do array indexes start with '0' in most languages?
This means that the index is used as an offset. <br />
The first element of the array is exactly contained in the memory location (0 elements) referenced by the array, so it must be marked as array [0]. <br />
Most programming languages ​​are designed this way, so indexing from zero is a basic feature regardless of languages.
